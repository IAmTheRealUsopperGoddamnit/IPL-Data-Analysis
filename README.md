# IPL-Data-Analysis
Data Analysis of IPL Matches from 2008-2020.
You can choose to see general analytics presented in graphs, filter, and sort data to your liking.
There are two versions of this codeâ€”Python & MySQL integrated version, and Python version.
In the former version, you cannot filter or sort data, but you instead enjoy a backend functionality which provides you additional information under graphs.
Keep in mind inputting is case-sensitive, so make sure to provide identical capitalization as shown in the options.
Enjoy.
